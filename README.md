# Selenium-Specflow-project-created-.net-core-2.2

 I am new to Specflow and have created this POC project.
 
 Here I have  deleted the Bin Obj and published folders as size was > 100 MB to upload.
 
 So anyone looking can clone the project and build on VS 2010. Microsoft .net core sdk is installed in my system
 
 Issue facing : When I build and publishproject..
   The exe generated in the Published folder doesn't Open and closes within a sec.
   
   When I ran the exe from CMD line I am getting this error.
   
   cd ..Path to Project\WebShopTestAutomation
    dotnet restore
    dotnet build
    dotnet test
   
   An assembly specified in the application dependencies menifest (WebShopTestAutomation.deps.json) hasalaready been found but a different file extension.
   
   Can anyone help me to resolve the error.
